💻 Aspiring Cybersecurity Professional | NCFE Level 2 & Level 3 Certificate in the Principles of Cyber Security Complete  
🔐 Building strong foundations across networking, Linux, and security principles

## 🚀 About Me
- 📘 Currently following a cyber security roadmap with hands-on labs
- 🎯 Preparing for the **CompTIA Security+** exam
- 🧰 Labs and tools: Kali Linux, Wireshark, Nmap, Netcat, TryHackMe
- ✍️ Logging my progress weekly to stay sharp and reflect on what I learn

## 🧠 Current Learning Focus
- Understanding the OSI model and how networks communicate  
- Practicing Linux CLI and scripting basics  
- Developing critical thinking through real-world TryHackMe rooms

- 📒 Cyber Learning Log (coming soon 😀)

## 🔭 Projects & Labs Coming Soon
- Security scanning examples with Nmap  
- Packet captures and analysis using Wireshark  
- My first Bash script! Completed on Thursday 19 June 2025 🥳 (see details under 'Progress Highlights So Far'
- - 🕵️‍♂️ Web Recon Project — Nmap, DNS, WHOIS & basic OSINT analysis (completed)

### 🚀 Progress Highlights So Far:
- 🧠 Completed 25+ hands-on **TryHackMe rooms** (Networking, DNS, HTTP, Linux & Windows Fundamentals)
- 💻 Built a custom cyber lab at home: **Kali Linux on UTM**, core tools (Nmap, Netcat, Wireshark), MacOS integration
- 📘 Studied **Security+ Domain 1–2** topics with Professor Messer videos & Anki flashcards
- 📝 Maintaining a daily **learning log** and reflecting to improve memory and retention
- 🌱 Building this GitHub as a live showcase of my journey, notes, and practical labs
- 👨🏽‍🎓 First bash script:
- [sysinfo.sh](https://github.com/Sanjay-Hacking/Sanjay-Hacking/blob/main/scripts/sysinfo.sh) – A basic script showing system info like user, uptime, memory, and disk usage

## 🏁 Milestone Unlocked: TryHackMe Pre-Security Path Complete!

I’ve officially completed the entire **TryHackMe Pre-Security Learning Path**, a guided journey through the core concepts every cybersecurity learner should master.

🧩 Topics Covered:
- Networking basics, DNS, HTTP, and packets & frames
- OSI model and how the web works
- Linux fundamentals (Parts 1–3) with command-line hands-on practice
- Windows fundamentals (Parts 1–3)
- Bash scripting & file permissions

🧠 This experience has helped me:
- Build confidence with Linux and terminal-based workflows
- Understand network traffic, protocols, and how systems communicate
- Prepare for more advanced hands-on rooms and real-world scenarios

📍 What’s Next: Starting **THM Junior Penetration Tester** path + continuing my roadmap with GitHub projects, Anki flashcards, and scripting labs.

  I’m learning out loud, and this space will grow with me — from theory to tools to real-world experience.

*Thanks for stopping by. I'm documenting my journey from beginner to Cyber Security pro - let’s connect and learn together!*
